# Question: How do you design a file system where you can create paths and add/get values? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided simulates a file system using a class named `FileSystem`. This class has a constructor that initializes the root of the file system as an empty object. The class also includes three methods: `createPath`, `addValue`, and `getValue`. The `createPath` method creates a new path in the file system by splitting the input path string into parts and iteratively adding new objects for each part to the nested object structure. The `addValue` method adds a value to a specified file in the file system. It navigates to the file by splitting the input path string into parts and traversing the nested object structure. If the path does not exist, it throws an error. Once it reaches the file, it assigns the input value to the file. The `getValue` method retrieves a value from a specified file in the file system. It navigates to the file in the same way as the `addValue` method. If the path or file does not exist, it throws an error. If the file exists, it returns the value of the file. This design allows for the creation of paths and the addition and retrieval of values in a simulated file system.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall approach to the problem. Both versions use a nested object structure to represent the file system and provide methods to create paths and get values. However, there are a few key differences:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the types of variables and function return values. For example, the `createPath` method is annotated to take a string and a number as arguments and return a boolean. This adds an extra layer of type safety that is not present in the JavaScript version.

2. Private Property: The TypeScript version declares the `root` property as private, which means it can only be accessed within the `FileSystem` class. This is a feature of TypeScript's class system that is not available in JavaScript.

3. Error Handling: The JavaScript version throws an error when trying to add a value to a non-existent path or get a value from a non-existent file. The TypeScript version, on the other hand, returns `false` or `null` in these cases. This is a design choice rather than a language feature difference.

4. Value Storage: In the JavaScript version, the value is directly stored in the file node. In the TypeScript version, each node is an object with a `value` property where the value is stored. This allows for more complex data to be stored in each node in the future.

5. Path Handling: In the JavaScript version, the path does not start with a '/'. In the TypeScript version, the path starts with a '/', and the `createPath` and `getValue` methods are adjusted accordingly. This is also a design choice rather than a language feature difference.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the problem solution also creates a `FileSystem` class with methods to create paths, add values to files, and get values from files. However, it uses a different data structure to represent the file system: an unordered map of unordered maps. Each key in the outer map represents a directory, and each key in the inner map represents a file in that directory. The value associated with each file key is the content of the file.

The `mkdir` method in the C++ version is equivalent to the `createPath` method in the JavaScript version. It creates a new path by splitting the input string into parts and creating new entries in the map for each part. The `addContentToFile` and `readContentFromFile` methods in the C++ version are equivalent to the `addValue` and `getValue` methods in the JavaScript version. They navigate to the specified file and add or retrieve the value, respectively.

The C++ version also includes a `ls` method, which lists the contents of a directory. This method is not present in the JavaScript version.

The C++ version uses several language features and methods that are not present in the JavaScript version, including:

- The `unordered_map` data structure, which is a hash table that allows for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of elements.
- The `istringstream` class, which is used to split the input string into parts.
- The `find_last_of` method, which finds the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- The `substr` method, which extracts a substring from a string.
- The `sort` function, which sorts the elements in a range.

The C++ version also uses the `iostream` library for input and output, whereas the JavaScript version uses the `console.log` function for output.
